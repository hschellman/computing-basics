## Introduction
There are four types of storage volumes that you will encounter at Fermilab (or CERN): 

- local hard drives
- network attached storage
- large-scale, distributed storage
- Rucio Storage Elements (RSE's) (a specific type of large-scale, distributed storage)
- CERN Virtual Machine File System (CVMFS)

Each has its own advantages and limitations, and knowing which one to use when isn't all straightforward or obvious. But with some amount of foresight, you can avoid some of the common pitfalls that have caught out other users.


## Vocabulary

**What is POSIX?** A volume with POSIX access (Portable Operating System Interface [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX)) allow users to directly read, write and modify using standard commands, e.g. using bash scripts, fopen(). In general, volumes mounted directly into the operating system.

**What is meant by 'grid accessible'?** Volumes that are grid accessible require specific tool suites to handle data stored there. Grid access to a volume is NOT POSIX access. This will be explained in the following sections.

**What is immutable?** A file that is immutable means that once it is written to the volume it cannot be modified. It can only be read, moved, or deleted. This property is in general a restriction imposed by the storage volume on which the file is stored. Not a good choice for code or other files you want to change.  

## Interactive storage volumes (mounted on dunegpvmXX.fnal.gov)

**Home area** is similar to the user's local hard drive but network mounted
* access speed to the volume very high, on top of full POSIX access
* network volumes are NOT safe to store certificates and tickets
* important: users have a single home area at FNAL used for all experiments 
* not accessible from grid worker nodes
* not for code developement (home area is less than 2 GB)
* at Fermilab, need a valid Kerberos ticket in order to access files in your Home area
* periodic snapshots are taken so you can recover deleted files. (/nashome/.snapshot)
* permissions are set so your collaborators cannot see files in your home area

> ## Note: your home area is small and private
> You want to use your home area for things that only you should see.  If you want to share files with collaborators you need to put them in the /app/ or /data/ areas described below. 
{: .callout}

**Locally mounted volumes** are physical disks, mounted directly on the computer
* physically inside the computer node you are remotely accessing
* mounted on the machine through the motherboard (not over network)
* used as temporary storage for infrastructure services (e.g. /var, /tmp,)
* can be used to store certificates and tickets. (These are saved there automatically with owner-read enabled and other permissions disabled.)
* usually very small and should not be used to store data files or for code development
* files on these volumes are not backed up

**Network Attached Storage (NAS)** element behaves similar to a locally mounted volume.
* functions similar to services such as Dropbox or OneDrive
* fast and stable POSIX access to these volumes
* volumes available only on a limited number of computers or servers
* not available on grid computing (FermiGrid, Open Science Grid, WLCG, HPC, etc.)
* /exp/dune/app/....<yourdir> has periodic snapshots in /exp/dune/app/....<yourdir>/.snap, but /exp/dune/data does NOT
* easy to share files with colleagues using /exp/dune/data and /exp/dune/app

## Grid-accessible storage volumes

At Fermilab, an instance of dCache+Enstore is used for large-scale, distributed storage with capacity for more than 100 PB of storage and O(10000) connections. Whenever possible, these storage elements should be accessed over xrootd (see next section) as the mount points on interactive nodes are slow, unstable, and can cause the node to become unusable. Here are the different dCache volumes:

**Persistent dCache**: the data in the file is actively available for reads at any time and will not be removed until manually deleted by user. 
There is now a second persistent dCache volume that is dedicated for DUNE Physics groups and managed by the respective physics conveners of those 
physics group.  https://wiki.dunescience.org/wiki/DUNE_Computing/Using_the_Physics_Groups_Persistent_Space_at_Fermilab gives more details on how to get 
access to these groups.  In general, if you need to store more than 5TB in persistent dCache you should be working with the Physics Groups areas.

**Scratch dCache**: large volume shared across all experiments. When a new file is written to scratch space, old files are removed in order to make room for the newer file. Removal is based on Least Recently Utilized (LRU) policy, and performed by an automated daemon.

**Tape-backed dCache**: disk based storage areas that have their contents mirrored to permanent storage on Enstore tape.  
Files are not available for immediate read on disk, but needs to be 'staged' from tape first ([see video of a tape storage robot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiNWOhl00Ao)).

**Resilient dCache**: NOTE: DIRECT USAGE is being phased out and if the Rapid Code Distribution function in POMS/jobsub does not work for you, consult with the FIFE team for a solution (handles custom user code for their grid jobs, often in the form of a tarball. Inappropriate to store any other files here (NO DATA OR NTUPLES)).

**Rucio Storage Elements**: Rucio Storage Elements (or RSEs) are storage elements provided by collaborating institution for official DUNE datasets.  Data stored in DUNE RSE's must be fully cataloged in the [metacat][metacat] catalog and is managed by the DUNE data management team. This is where you find the official data samples.

**CVMFS**: CERN Virtual Machine File System is a centrally managed storage area that is distributed over the network, and utilized to distribute common software and a limited set of reference files. CVMFS is mounted over the network, and can be utilized on grid nodes, interactive nodes, and personal desktops/laptops. It is read only, and the most common source for centrally maintained versions of experiment software libraries/executables. CVMFS is mounted at `/cvmfs/` and access is POSIX-like, but read only. 

> ## Note - When reading from dcache always use the root: syntax, not direct /pnfs
> The Fermilab dcache areas have NFS mounts.  These are for your convenience, they allow you to look at the directory structure and, for example, remove files.  However, NFS access is slow, inconsistent, and can hang the machine if I/O heavy processes use it.  Always use the `xroot root://<site>` ... when reading/accessing files instead of `/pnfs/` directly.  Once you have your dune environment set up the `pnfs2xrootd` command can do the conversion to `root:` format for you (only for files at FNAL for now).

## Monitoring and Usage
Remember that these volumes are not infinite, and monitoring your and the experiment's usage of these volumes is important to smooth access to data and simulation samples. To see your persistent usage visit [here](https://fifemon.fnal.gov/monitor/d/000000175/dcache-persistent-usage-by-vo?orgId=1&var-VO=dune) (bottom left):

And to see the total volume usage at Rucio Storage Elements around the world:

**Resource** [DUNE Rucio Storage](https://dune.monitoring.edi.scotgrid.ac.uk/app/dashboards#/view/7eb1cea0-ca5e-11ea-b9a5-15b75a959b33?_g=(filters:!(),refreshInterval:(pause:!t,value:0),time:(from:now-1d,to:now)))

> ## Note - do not blindly copy files from personal machines to DUNE systems.
> You may have files on your personal machine that contain personal information, licensed software or (god forbid) malware or pornography.  Do not transfer any files from your personal machine to DUNE machines unless they are directly related to work on DUNE.  You must be fully aware of any file's contents. We have seen it all and we do not want to.

## Commands and tools
This section will teach you the main tools and commands to display storage information and access data.

### ifdh 

Another useful data handling command you will soon come across is ifdh. This stands for Intensity Frontier Data Handling. It is a tool suite that facilitates selecting the appropriate data transfer method from many possibilities while protecting shared resources from overload. You may see *ifdhc*, where *c* refers to *client*.

> ## Note
>  ifdh is much more efficient than NFS file access.  Please use it and/or xroot when accessing remote files. 
{: .challenge}

Here is an example to copy a file. Refer to the [Mission Setup]({{ site.baseurl }}/setup.html) for the setting up the `DUNELAR_VERSION`.

### xrootd 
The eXtended ROOT daemon is a software framework designed for accessing data from various architectures in a complete scalable way (in size and performance). 

XRootD is most suitable for read-only data access.
[XRootD Man pages](https://xrootd.slac.stanford.edu/docs.html)

Issue the following command. Please look at the input and output of the command, and recognize that this is a listing of /pnfs/dune/scratch/users/${USER}/DUNE_tutorial_2024. Try and understand how the translation between a NFS path and an xrootd URI could be done by hand if you needed to do so.

~~~
xrdfs root://fndca1.fnal.gov:1094/ ls /pnfs/fnal.gov/usr/dune/scratch/users/${USER}/
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Note that you can do
~~~
lar -c <input.fcl> <xrootd_uri> 
~~~
{: .language-bash}

to stream into a larsoft module configured within the fhicl file. As well, it can be implemented in standalone C++ as

~~~
TFile * thefile = TFile::Open(<xrootd_uri>)
~~~
{: .language-c++}

or PyROOT code as

~~~
thefile = ROOT.TFile.Open(<xrootd_uri>)
~~~
{: .language-python}

### What is the right xroot path for a file.

If a file is in `/pnfs/dune/tape_backed/dunepro/protodune-sp/reco-recalibrated/2021/detector/physics/PDSPProd4/00/00/51/41/np04_raw_run005141_0003_dl9_reco1_18127219_0_20210318T104440Z_reco2_51835174_0_20211231T143346Z.root`

the command 

~~~
pnfs2xrootd /pnfs/dune/tape_backed/dunepro/protodune-sp/reco-recalibrated/2021/detector/physics/PDSPProd4/00/00/51/41/np04_raw_run005141_0003_dl9_reco1_18127219_0_20210318T104440Z_reco2_51835174_0_20211231T143346Z.root
~~~
{: .language-bash}


will return the correct xrootd uri: 

~~~
root://fndca1.fnal.gov:1094//pnfs/fnal.gov/usr/dune/tape_backed/dunepro/protodune-sp/reco-recalibrated/2021/detector/physics/PDSPProd4/00/00/51/41/np04_raw_run005141_0003_dl9_reco1_18127219_0_20210318T104440Z_reco2_51835174_0_20211231T143346Z.root
~~~
{: .output}

you can then 

~~~ 
root -l <that long root: path>
~~~ 
{: .language-bash}

to open the root file.  

This even works if the file is in Europe - which you cannot do with a direct /pnfs! (NOTE! not all storage elements accept tokens, so right now this will fail if you have a token in your environment! Times out over ~10 minutes.)

## Let's practice

> ## Exercise 2
> Using a combination of `ifdh` and `xrootd` commands discussed previously:
> * Use `ifdh locateFile <file> root` to find the directory for this file `PDSPProd4a_protoDUNE_sp_reco_stage1_p1GeV_35ms_sce_off_43352322_0_20210427T162252Z.root`
> * Use `xrdcp` to copy that file to `/pnfs/dune/scratch/users/${USER}/DUNE_tutorial_2024_data_file`
> * Using `xrdfs` and the `ls` option, count the number of files in the same directory as `PDSPProd4a_protoDUNE_sp_reco_stage1_p1GeV_35ms_sce_off_43352322_0_20210427T162252Z.root`

### The df command

To find out what types of volumes are available on a node can be achieved with the command `df`. The `-h` is for _human readable format_. It will list a lot of information about each volume (total size, available size, mount point, device location).
~~~
df -h
