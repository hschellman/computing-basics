title: Data Management (2024 in progress))
teaching: 40
exercises: 0
questions:
- What are the data management tools and software for DUNE? 
- How are different software versions handled? 
- What are the best data management practices? 
objectives:
- Learn how to access data from DUNE Data Catalog.
- Understand the roles of the tools UPS, mrb and CVMFS. 
keypoints:
- SAM and Rucio are data handling systems used by the DUNE collaboration to retrieve data.
- Staging is a necessary step to make sure files are on disk in dCache (as opposed to only on tape).
- Xrootd allows user to stream data file. 
- The Unix Product Setup (UPS) is a tool to ensure consistency between different software versions and reproducibility.
- The multi-repository build (mrb) tool allows code modification in multiple repositories, which is relevant for a large project like LArSoft with different cases (end user and developers) demanding consistency between the builds.
- CVMFS distributes software and related files without installing them on the target computer (using a VM, Virtual Machine).

> We are in the middle of a major transition to metacat/rucio -  we suggest using this tutorial first to find out about data
