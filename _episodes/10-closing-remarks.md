## Two Days of Training

The instruction in this one day version of the DUNE computing workshop was provided by several experienced physicists and is based on years of experience. 

The secure access to Fermilab computing systems and a familiarity with data storage are key components.

Data management and event processing tools were described and modeled. 

Art and LArSoft were introduced

We are thankful for the instructor's hard work, and for the numerous participants who joined.
