## You can ask questions here:

- [DUNE Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T03RN7KU3/C03RN7KV9) (collaborators only)

    Channels `#computing-training-basics` and `#larsoft-beginners` are a good start.  `#user_grid_usage` is where you go to check if there are system problems.

- [DUNE computing FAQ](https://github.com/orgs/DUNE/projects/19/views/1)
